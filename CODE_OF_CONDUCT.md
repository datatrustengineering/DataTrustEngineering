title: Code of Conduct
---

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, the  
**Data Trust Engineering (DTE)** community, pledge to make participation in our  
project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of  
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of  
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,  
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our mission is to replace traditional data governance with engineering-driven  
trust, certification, and AI-readiness, as outlined in the  
[Data Trust Engineering Manifesto](/Manifesto.md). Inspired by the collaborative  
spirit of the [DataTrustManifesto](https://datatrustmanifesto.org), we aim to  
build a community where data professionals, enterprises, SMBs, and hyperscalers  
collaborate to certify data systems by use case, risk, and value. This Code of  
Conduct ensures our community remains respectful, productive, and aligned with  
the #DTERevolution.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.  
- Focusing on contributions that advance DTE’s mission (e.g., artifacts like  
  the Trust Dashboard, case studies, or manifesto updates).  
- Showing empathy towards other community members.  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political  
  attacks.  
- Public or private harassment.  
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., email addresses) without  
  permission.  
- Submitting off-topic contributions that do not align with DTE’s focus on data  
  trust, certification, or AI-readiness.  
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a  
  professional setting.  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable  
behavior and taking appropriate, fair corrective action in response to any  
instances of unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right and  
responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, pull requests, or  
  other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.  
- Lock conversations or block contributors temporarily or permanently for  
  inappropriate behavior.  
- Ensure contributions align with DTE’s mission, as defined in the  
  [Manifesto](/Manifesto.md) and  
  [Contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).  

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- The `DataTrustEngineering` GitHub repository (issues, pull requests,  
  discussions).  
- The [datatrustengineering Slack org](https://join.slack.com/t/datatrustengineering/shared_invite/zt-3br05le6v-pxGSBeJGLpVgOsNM9ejGuw)  
  (#general, #contributions, etc.).  
- Public interactions referencing DTE, such as posts on X with #DTERevolution.  
- Any other DTE-related events or platforms (e.g.,  
  [datatrustmanifesto.org](https://datatrustmanifesto.org)).  

It also applies when an individual represents the project in public spaces,  
such as speaking on behalf of DTE or promoting the #DTERevolution.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be  
reported by contacting the project maintainers at **bbrewer@infolibcorp.com** or  
via GitHub Issues (private message preferred for sensitive issues). All  
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers will:

- Respond to reports within 48 hours, acknowledging receipt.  
- Investigate and take action (e.g., warning, content removal, or blocking)  
  based on the severity of the violation.  
- Maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter, unless permission is granted  
  to disclose.  

Possible actions include:

- **Warning**: A private or public request to stop the behavior, citing this  
  Code of Conduct.  
- **Content Removal**: Deleting or editing comments, issues, or pull requests  
  that violate standards.  
- **Conversation Locking**: Temporarily locking heated discussions to restore  
  order.  
- **Temporary or Permanent Ban**: Blocking contributors who repeatedly violate  
  the Code of Conduct.  

## Reporting Guidelines

To report a violation, provide:

- A description of the incident (e.g., “Off-topic rant in issue #123”).  
- Screenshots or links to the content, if applicable.  
- Your preferred contact method for follow-up.
