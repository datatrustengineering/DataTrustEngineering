# Data Debt in Data & AI Systems

Technical debt is inevitable in every engineering discipline ‚Äî data and AI are no exception. The purpose of this section is not to eliminate debt, but to **make it visible, measurable, and manageable**. 

In traditional governance, debt hides in endless policies and committees. In **Data Trust Engineering (DTE)**, debt is treated like code: tracked, budgeted, and paid down through engineering discipline and automation.

## Mission of This Section

- **Expose Invisible Debt**: Shine light on the hidden costs of pipeline fragility, schema drift, model decay, and ‚Äúhero debugging.‚Äù  
- **Provide Practical Patterns**: Offer lightweight, reproducible design patterns that teams can apply incrementally.  
- **Baseline, Not Framework**: These are **guides and recipes**, not full-blown products. The goal is to show where to start, not to replace the entire ecosystem.  
- **Engineer-First**: Patterns focus on **observability, contracts, lineage, and SLOs**, not on policy enforcement or compliance checklists.  

## Why It Matters

- **70‚Äì85% of governance programs fail** (Gartner, 2025), often because they ignore technical debt until it‚Äôs too late.  
- AI systems add new forms of debt: drift, bias, fairness regressions.  
- Without clear **trust SLOs and error budgets**, teams ship features while debt compounds silently.

## Design Patterns: Technical Debt in Data & AI

Below are practical design patterns that help manage technical debt in pipelines, models, and contracts while maintaining delivery velocity. Each pattern is:  
- **Lightweight** (Markdown, dbt tests, Great Expectations suites)  
- **Observable** (Superset/Metabase dashboards, OpenLineage events)  
- **Community-Driven** (fork and adapt, PR improvements)  

> üí° These patterns form the **baseline playbook** for DTE teams. They are not mandates, but starting points for contributors to extend.


# Design Patterns: Technical Debt in Data & AI

Technical debt isn‚Äôt a moral failing; it‚Äôs a budget. These patterns make debt **visible, measurable, and payable**‚Äîwithout halting delivery.

## 1) Data Debt Ledger
**Problem:** Invisible debt accumulates across pipelines, models, and contracts.  
**Pattern:** Maintain a lightweight, git-tracked `DATA_DEBT.md` (one per domain) listing items, impact, principal, interest (ongoing cost), and a due date.  
**Signals:** MTTR ‚Üë, ad-hoc fixes ‚Üë, ‚Äúhero debugging‚Äù stories.  
**Artifacts:** Markdown ledger + GitHub Issues labels `debt/*`.

## 2) Contract Drift Guard (Shift-Left)
**Problem:** Producers change payloads; downstream breaks later.  
**Pattern:** Enforce **data contracts at ingestion** (jsonschema + Great Expectations). Fail fast on drift; open an issue automatically.  
**Signals:** Contract violations %, time-to-detect drift.  
**Artifacts:** `contracts/*.json`, CI step `contract-validate`.

## 3) Schema Freeze Windows
**Problem:** Breaking changes land during peak loads.  
**Pattern:** Calendarized ‚Äúfreeze windows‚Äù + `dbt` CI rule requiring `BREAKING_CHANGE_APPROVED=true`.  
**Signals:** Incidents during release windows, weekend pages.  
**Artifacts:** `dbt` pre-commit + release calendar.

## 4) Strangler-Fig Modernization
**Problem:** Monolithic, fragile pipelines.  
**Pattern:** Route critical slices to a **new, small, governed path**, retire old nodes incrementally.  
**Signals:** Size/complexity ‚Üë; change failure rate ‚Üë.  
**Artifacts:** Routing map, retirement checklist.

## 5) Trust SLOs & Error Budgets
**Problem:** Quality is subjective; tradeoffs unclear.  
**Pattern:** Define **SLOs for trust** (e.g., Freshness ‚â§ 60m p95, Null rate ‚â§ 0.5%, Contract violations ‚â§ 0.1%). Burn error budgets before feature work.  
**Signals:** SLO burn-down, breach frequency.  
**Artifacts:** SLO YAML + dashboard tiles.

## 6) Test Pyramid for Data
**Problem:** Only end-to-end tests; slow and flaky.  
**Pattern:** **80% unit** (dbt/gx expectations at model/column), **15% integration** (contract+lineage), **5% e2e**.  
**Signals:** Flaky test rate, time-to-signal.  
**Artifacts:** `schema.yml` tests, GE suites, a small e2e harness.

## 7) Idempotent Backfills
**Problem:** Backfills create duplicates and replays.  
**Pattern:** Design jobs to be **idempotent** (natural keys, merge/upsert, watermarking).  
**Signals:** Duplicate keys, non-deterministic counts across runs.  
**Artifacts:** Upsert macros, watermark processors.

## 8) Freshness & Staleness Budgets
**Problem:** Silent data rot.  
**Pattern:** Define freshness budgets per product; alert when exceeded; degrade gracefully (label as ‚Äústale‚Äù).  
**Signals:** Freshness p95, stale-data reads.  
**Artifacts:** `dbt source freshness`, dashboard badges.

## 9) Lineage-Verified Changes
**Problem:** Hidden blast radius.  
**Pattern:** **OpenLineage** events in CI: compute impact set from lineage; require approvals when blast radius > threshold.  
**Signals:** Post-deploy breakages in ‚Äúunknown‚Äù downstreams.  
**Artifacts:** OpenLineage emitter + CI guard.

## 10) Canonicalization & De-Dup
**Problem:** Divergent entity definitions inflate debt.  
**Pattern:** Centralize entity resolution (keys, survivorship rules), emit **golden tables** with provenance.  
**Signals:** Conflicting KPIs, ‚Äútwo truths‚Äù debates.  
**Artifacts:** Canonical model + dedupe rules in dbt.

## 11) Observability Budget
**Problem:** No time for metrics/logs/traces.  
**Pattern:** Allocate a fixed % of each story to add/upgrade **observability tied to trust indicators** (freshness, nulls, contract violations, lineage gaps).  
**Signals:** Incidents without telemetry; mean time to *know* ‚Üë.  
**Artifacts:** Metrics spec + dashboard checklist.

## 12) Teardown Sprints (2‚Äì4 Weeks)
**Problem:** Compounded complexity; progress stalls.  
**Pattern:** Focused ‚Äúteardown & simplify‚Äù sprints: remove dead code, reduce DAG depth, collapse over-abstractions, archive orphan tables.  
**Signals:** Lead time ‚Üë, failed runs ‚Üë, engineer sentiment ‚Üì.  
**Artifacts:** Before/after metrics: DAG depth, model count, build time.

## Minimal Metrics to Track (Debt KPIs)
- **Contract violation rate** (per 1k msgs)  
- **Freshness p95** / **SLO breaches**  
- **Flaky test rate** & **time-to-signal**  
- **Orphan/unused tables %**  
- **Duplicate natural keys %**  
- **Incident MTTR** and **change failure rate**  

## Lightweight Tooling (Open Source)
- **dbt tests** (`not_null`, `unique`, custom macros)  
- **Great Expectations** (expectations + suites)  
- **OpenLineage** (lineage & blast radius checks)  
- **YData Profiling** (profiling ‚Üí confidence indicators)  
- **Superset/Metabase** (Trust SLO dashboards)
