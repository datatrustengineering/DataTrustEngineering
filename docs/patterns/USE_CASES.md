## Data Trust Engineering (DTE) Use Cases and Trust Dashboard

Welcome to the **Data Trust Engineering (DTE) Use Cases** and **Trust Dashboard**, practical examples that demonstrate DTE principles in action. These open-source tools and examples embody DTE's principles of trust, engineering rigor, and AI-readiness as outlined in the [Data Trust Manifesto](../Manifesto.md).
---

## Mission for Examples & Design Patterns

The examples in this guide are designed as **illustrations, not end-to-end products**. Each one shows how DTE principles can be applied in practice using open-source components. Think of them as **recipes** that teams can fork, adapt, and extend—not polished systems.

Over time, these examples will also evolve into a library of **design patterns for Trust Engineering**.
- Patterns for **shift-left quality** (contracts at ingestion)
- Patterns for **lineage and observability** (OpenLineage integration, monitoring pipelines in real time)
- Patterns for **AI trust** (fairness, explainability, drift checks)
- Patterns for **AI evaluations** (systematic LLM/RAG evals, confidence scoring, guardrail testing)
- Patterns for **observability** (metrics, logging, tracing tied to trust indicators)
- Patterns for **technical debt management** (dbt tests, Great Expectations)

The goal is to provide **starting points** and **reusable patterns** that make trust engineering approachable, repeatable, and community-driven.

## Purpose of the Use Cases

These use cases are not full-blown projects or attempts to rebuild the entire ecosystem of governance and AI tools. The ecosystem is already too large and fragmented. Instead, the purpose is to act as a guide with examples, showing how open-source components can be applied to real trust problems.

- **Baseline, not best-in-class**: The goal is not to compete with enterprise tools, but to set a baseline reference that's easy to understand and extend.
- **Trust Dashboard as MVP**: This is the anchor artifact — a lightweight starting point that demonstrates DTE principles (trust, rigor, AI-readiness) in a tangible way.
- **Examples, not platforms**: Each use case is a recipe (e.g., data contracts at ingestion, lineage with OpenLineage, fairness checks with Fairlearn), not a production-ready service.
- **Community-first**: The structure invites contributions, but the priority is to show how to start, not to provide a polished ecosystem out of the gate.



## The DTE Trust Dashboard

The **DTE Trust Dashboard** is a practical, open-source artifact that visualizes real-time trust metrics. It empowers teams to build trusted, scalable systems for high-stakes use cases such as AI training, regulatory reporting, and GenAI safety.

### Implementations
- **HTML Version (`DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html`)**
  Built with Chart.js for lightweight, static visualization.
- **Streamlit Version (`app.py`)**
  Built with Streamlit and Plotly for interactive, Python-based visualization.

Both versions monitor key metrics:
- **AI Fairness** (Fairlearn) — fairness scores across protected attributes (e.g., gender, age).
- **Model Explainability** (Evidently AI) — feature importance visualization.
- **Guardrails Adherence** — radar chart showing adherence to DTE principles: trust, certification by use case/risk/value, observability.
- **GenAI Safety** (Evidently AI) — metrics for toxicity, bias, hallucination, privacy leakage, factual accuracy.
- **Model Performance** (MLflow) — accuracy, F1, AUC-ROC over time.

### DTE Principles in Action
- **Trust**: Transparent, real-time metrics build confidence for enterprises, users, and AI systems.
- **Engineering Rigor**: Robust implementation with lightweight open-source tools (Chart.js, Plotly, Superset).
- **Collaboration**: Open, extensible design inviting community contributions.

### Getting Started
**HTML Version**
```bash
# Open in browser
open tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html
# Or host via GitHub Pages or a simple web server
```

**Streamlit Version**
```bash
cd tools/data-trust-dashboard
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
# Access at http://localhost:8501
```

**Extend the Dashboard**
- **Data Quality**: Integrate Great Expectations.
- **Lineage**: Connect Apache Atlas.
- **AI Governance**: Add Fairlearn, Evidently AI, MLflow, or SDV.

## Practical Use Cases for DTE

The following **use cases** demonstrate how to implement DTE principles with open-source code. Each includes a description, its alignment with DTE, and a code artifact.

---

### 1. Trust Dashboard
See **The DTE Trust Dashboard** above — a working example implementation.

---

### 2. Agentic Workflows Trust
Validate agent decisions with logged outputs for auditability.
**Artifact**: [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) + [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations).

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from great_expectations.dataset import PandasDataset
import pandas as pd, json

def validate_data(input_data: str) -> str:
    df = pd.read_json(input_data)
    dataset = PandasDataset(df)
    result = dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_unique("id").to_json_dict()
    return json.dumps({"success": result["success"], "details": result["result"]})

tools = [Tool(name="DataValidator", func=validate_data, description="Validates uniqueness")]
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key="your-openai-key")
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description")

data = pd.DataFrame({"id": [1, 2, 2, 4]}).to_json()
result = agent.run(f"Validate this data for uniqueness: {data}")
```

### 3. RAG / GraphRAG
Ground LLMs in trusted knowledge graphs.
**Artifact**: [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j) + LangChain.

```python
from langchain_community.graphs import Neo4jGraph
from langchain.chains import GraphQAChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

graph = Neo4jGraph(url="bolt://localhost:7687", username="neo4j", password="password")
graph.query("""
CREATE (p:Principle {name: "Transparency"})
CREATE (p2:Principle {name: "Accountability"})
CREATE (p)-[:RELATED_TO]->(p2)
""")

llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key="your-openai-key")
chain = GraphQAChain.from_llm(llm, graph=graph)
print(chain.run("What principles are related to Transparency?"))
```

  version: 1.0.0
  schema:
    fields:
      - name: user_id
        type: string
        required: true
        unique: true
      - name: event_timestamp
        type: timestamp

{{ config(materialized='table') }}
SELECT user_id, event_timestamp, COUNT(*) as event_count
FROM {{ source('raw', 'user_events') }}
GROUP BY user_id, event_timestamp
