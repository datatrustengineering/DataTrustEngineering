# Certification (DTE Pattern)

## Mission

In Data Trust Engineering, **certification means risk-tiered assurance**, not regulatory box-ticking.  
Certification artifacts provide transparent, engineering-driven evidence that a dataset, pipeline, or model meets agreed trust criteria for its **use case, risk, and business value**.

- **Not compliance theater**: Legal/audit teams handle GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act.  
- **Yes to technical trust**: Engineers produce certification packs (metrics, lineage, tests) that auditors and teams can reuse.  
- **Practical baseline**: Certification in DTE is lightweight, automated, and versioned in Git/GitHub.  

---

## Design Patterns for Certification

### 1) Evidence Packs
- Collect trust metrics (quality, lineage, fairness, explainability).  
- Emit JSON/HTML artifacts and publish with PRs.  
- Store in `artifacts/certification/`.  

### 2) Risk-Tiered Levels
- **Low risk**: schema validated, freshness tracked.  
- **Medium risk**: + quality SLOs, lineage verified.  
- **High risk**: + fairness checks, robustness, explainability.  
- Escalate assurance as stakes increase.  

### 3) Certification as Code
- Define certification rules in YAML or Python.  
- Run checks in CI pipelines.  
- Tag certified versions in Git.  

### 4) Living Certificates
- Certificates evolve with data/models.  
- Re-run on every release; expire on drift.  
- Certification status = dynamic, not permanent.

## Example: Certification Harness

```python
# certify.py
import json, pandas as pd
from great_expectations.dataset import PandasDataset
from openlineage.client import OpenLineageClient, RunEvent, Run, Job, Dataset, RunState
from datetime import datetime

CERT_FILE = "artifacts/certification/customer_orders.json"

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("data/customer_orders.csv")
dataset = PandasDataset(df)

# 1) Quality checks
results = [
    dataset.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("order_id"),
    dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_unique("order_id")
]
quality_score = sum(r["success"] for r in results) / len(results)

# 2) Lineage check (OpenLineage emit)
client = OpenLineageClient(url="http://localhost:5000", api_key="")
event = RunEvent(
    eventType=RunState.COMPLETE,
    eventTime=datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
    run=Run(runId="cert-1234"),
    job=Job(namespace="dte.cert", name="customer_orders_pipeline"),
    inputs=[Dataset(namespace="raw", name="orders_raw")],
    outputs=[Dataset(namespace="dte.cert", name="customer_orders")]
)
client.emit(event)

# 3) Certification record
cert = {
  "dataset": "customer_orders",
  "quality_score": quality_score,
  "lineage": "openlineage emitted",
  "certified": quality_score > 0.9
}

json.dump(cert, open(CERT_FILE, "w"), indent=2)
print(f"Certification evidence written to {CERT_FILE}")
```

## Minimal Certification Criteria

- **Schema validated** (jsonschema/dbt tests).  
- **Quality checks** (nulls, uniqueness, ranges).  
- **Lineage evidence** (OpenLineage runs).  
- **Fairness / explainability** (for ML/AI).  
- **Freshness** (SLO checks).  

---

## Why This Matters

Traditional governance tries to “declare” compliance.  
DTE certification **demonstrates** trustworthiness with transparent artifacts.  

- **Auditors**: Reuse artifacts for compliance evidence.  
- **Engineers**: Automate checks in pipelines.  
- **Stakeholders**: See clear assurance, tied to risk and value.

## Contribute

- Add new certification harnesses (`tools/certification/`).  
- Extend criteria for specific domains (finance, healthcare, AI).  
- Submit PRs with real-world examples.
