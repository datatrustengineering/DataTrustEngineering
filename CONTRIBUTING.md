title: Contributing to Data Trust Engineering (DTE)
---

Welcome to the **Data Trust Engineering (DTE)** community! We're building a collaborative ecosystem of practical patterns and tools that help data teams implement trust and reliability in their AI and data systems. Inspired by successful open-source communities, DTE brings together data professionals from diverse backgrounds to share proven approaches for certification, monitoring, and quality assurance. Whether you're enhancing the [DTE Trust Dashboard](/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html), proposing new artifacts, or sharing case studies, your contributions help advance practical data trust engineering.

This guide explains how to contribute to the `DataTrustEngineering` repository, ensuring a productive, inclusive community. Join us at [datatrustmanifesto.org](https://datatrustmanifesto.org) or our [Slack org]([Slack Invite Link]).

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), based on the Contributor Covenant. Be respectful, constructive, and focused on DTE's mission to provide practical engineering patterns for data trust. Harassment, off-topic discussions, or disruptive behavior will be addressed by maintainers to keep our community welcoming.

## What Can You Contribute?

DTE is a community-driven initiative, and we welcome contributions that align with our [Manifesto](/Manifesto.md) and advance practical data trust engineering. Examples include:

- **Artifacts**: Tools and scripts for data quality (e.g., Great Expectations configurations), lineage tracking (e.g., OpenLineage integrations), or AI governance (e.g., Fairlearn monitoring patterns). See `/tools`.
- **Patterns and Guides**: Document proven approaches and best practices in `/docs/patterns`.
- **Case Studies**: Share real-world implementations and lessons learned in `/docs/case-studies`. Use our [template](/docs/case-studies/template).
- **Trust Dashboard Enhancements**: Add metrics, integrations, or UI improvements to `/tools/data-trust-dashboard`.
- **Documentation**: Improve clarity, add examples, or create tutorials in `/docs`.
- **Code Examples**: Contribute working implementations that others can adapt and extend.

**Good First Issues**: New to DTE? Start with issues tagged "good first issue" (e.g., documentation improvements, adding examples, or fixing typos). These are great ways to learn and contribute to the community!

## How to Contribute

1. **Explore the Repo**:
   - Read the [README.md](/README.md) and [Manifesto.md](/Manifesto.md) to understand DTE's approach.
   - Check `/tools` and `/docs` for existing artifacts and inspiration.
   - Review [USE_CASES.md](/docs/patterns/USE_CASES.md) for practical implementation examples.

2. **Discuss Your Idea**:
   - Open a GitHub Issue to propose your contribution (e.g., "New pattern: Data quality validation workflow"). Use our issue templates for clarity.
   - Join our [Slack org]([Slack Invite Link]) (#contributions channel) to discuss ideas with the community.

3. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/DataTrustEngineering.git
   cd DataTrustEngineering
   ```
   - Fork the repo on GitHub to create your own copy.

4. **Make Changes**:
   - Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name`.
   - Add your contribution (e.g., a pattern in `/docs/patterns`, a script in `/tools`).
   - Commit with a clear message: `git commit -m "Add data quality validation pattern"`.

5. **Push and Submit a PR**:
   - Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-contribution-name`.
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main branch, describing your changes and linking to the relevant issue.

## Pull Request Process

We review PRs to ensure alignment with DTE's principles and community standards. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a PR**:
   - Use a descriptive title (e.g., "Add lineage tracking pattern with OpenLineage").
   - Link to the related GitHub Issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
   - Explain your changes and how they benefit the community.

2. **Review Process**:
   - Maintainers will review within 5-7 days, checking for:
     - Alignment with the [DTE Manifesto](/Manifesto.md).
     - Code/documentation quality (e.g., markdown linting, functional examples).
     - Relevance to DTE's goals (e.g., practical implementation patterns).
   - Expect constructive feedback (e.g., "Can you add an example for cloud deployments?"). Revise as needed.

3. **Automated Checks**:
   - PRs undergo markdown linting (via GitHub Actions) for documentation consistency.
   - Code-based artifacts should include basic validation or example usage.

4. **Approval and Merge**:
   - Approved PRs are merged into the main branch.
   - If a PR doesn't align with our focus, we'll provide feedback and suggest alternative approaches.

## Community Guidelines

- **Stay On-Topic**: Contributions should support DTE's focus on practical data trust engineering. Off-topic ideas may be redirected to more appropriate forums.
- **Be Collaborative**: Engage in GitHub Discussions or community channels before submitting large changes to align with shared goals.
- **Respect Feedback**: Maintainers may request changes to ensure quality and consistency. Respond constructively to help improve the contribution.
- **Avoid Chaos**: Follow the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Disruptive behavior may lead to warnings or temporary blocks.

## Recognition

- Listing you in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` with your permission.
- Highlighting valuable contributions in community channels.
- Offering opportunities for deeper involvement based on sustained contributions.

## Questions or Ideas?

- **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue for questions, ideas, or feedback.
- **Community Discussion**: Join our Slack channels for real-time conversations.
- **Documentation**: Check our patterns and guides for implementation examples.
