## Bug Report

Thank you for helping improve **Data Trust Engineering (DTE)**! This template helps us address issues in artifacts like the [DTE Trust Dashboard](/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html) or documentation. Please provide clear details to ensure quick resolution, aligning with our mission to certify data systems for trust and AI-readiness. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.

### Describe the Bug
A clear description of the issue (e.g., “Trust Dashboard chart fails to load data”).

### Steps to Reproduce
1. [e.g., Open DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html in Chrome]
2. [e.g., Load sample dataset]
3. [e.g., Click ‘Refresh Metrics’ button]
4. [e.g., Observe error: ‘TypeError: data is undefined’]

### Expected Behavior
What should happen? (e.g., “Chart should display fairness metrics.”)

### Actual Behavior
What happens instead? (e.g., “Chart remains blank with console error.”)

### Environment
- **Browser/OS**: [e.g., Chrome 128 on Windows 11]
- **Artifact**: [e.g., DTE Trust Dashboard, lineage-script.py]
- **Version/Commit**: [e.g., latest main branch, commit abc123]
- **Dependencies**: [e.g., Chart.js 4.4.2, Python 3.10]

### Screenshots or Logs
Attach screenshots, console errors, or logs if applicable. [Drag and drop files here or link to them.]

### Additional Context
Any other details? (e.g., “Happens only with large datasets,” “Related to #123.”)

### Suggested Fix (Optional)
If you have ideas for a fix, share them! (e.g., “Check if data is undefined before rendering chart.”)
