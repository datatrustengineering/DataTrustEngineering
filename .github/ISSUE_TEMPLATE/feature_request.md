## Feature Request

Thank you for contributing to **Data Trust Engineering (DTE)**! This template helps propose new features, such as enhancements to the [DTE Trust Dashboard](/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html), new artifacts (e.g., data quality scripts, lineage trackers), or updates to the [Manifesto](/Manifesto.md). Please provide clear details to align with our mission to certify data systems by use case, risk, and value. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/community/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.

### Description
What feature or enhancement are you proposing? (e.g., “Add WebSocket support to Trust Dashboard for real-time updates,” “New manifesto principle on data sovereignty.”)

### Alignment with DTE
How does this feature advance DTE’s mission of trust, certification, and AI-readiness? (e.g., “Supports real-time data drift monitoring for AI governance,” “Aligns with EU AI Act transparency requirements.”)

### Proposed Implementation
Describe how the feature could be implemented. Include:
- **Location**: Where in the repo? (e.g., `/tools/data-trust-dashboard`, `/Manifesto.md`)
- **Tools/Technologies**: Any specific tools? (e.g., Great Expectations, Apache Atlas, Fairlearn)
- **Example**: A mock-up or code snippet, if applicable.
  ```python
  # Example: Add drift detection to Trust Dashboard
  from evidently.pipeline import Pipeline
  pipeline = Pipeline(...)  # Add to DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html
  ```

### Use Case
Who benefits and how? (e.g., “Enterprises need real-time compliance metrics,” “SMBs benefit from lightweight data quality checks.”)

### Additional Context
Any other details? (e.g., “Inspired by DataOps Principle #1: Continual feedback,” “Related to issue #123.”)
