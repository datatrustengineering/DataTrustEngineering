title: Data Trust Engineering (DTE) Manifesto
---

## Mission

Data Trust Engineering (DTE) empowers data professionals to build trusted, AI-ready systems through collaborative engineering practices and open-source patterns. This manifesto outlines practical principles for certifying data systems by use case, risk, and value, moving beyond rigid governance frameworks toward adaptable, engineering-driven solutions. Our vendor-neutral community develops the implementation approaches, creating shared tools and patterns that work across diverse organizational contexts.

## Rationale

Data Trust Engineering emerged from the practical challenges data teams face when building reliable systems in complex, fast-moving environments. Organizations struggle with data governance complexity, where compliance requirements often overshadow technical data management needs. Born from collective experience across engineering teams, DTE redefines data management as a collaborative engineering discipline focused on practical certification patterns.

DTE draws inspiration from successful open-source movements and agile development practices, evolving beyond traditional governance's rigid, process-heavy approaches. Instead of vendor-driven frameworks, DTE empowers communities to shape practical solutions through collaborative tools and shared knowledge.

DTE's foundation rests on three practical insights:

**Diverse Organizational Needs**: Different organizations require different approaches—enterprises need scalable compliance-adjacent solutions, SMBs seek lightweight implementations, and cloud-native teams require flexible, API-driven patterns.

**AI Implementation Challenges**: Data quality issues frequently impact AI projects, requiring practical monitoring and validation approaches that integrate with existing engineering workflows.

**Technical vs. Compliance Focus**: While compliance remains important for legal and audit teams, DTE enables engineering teams to focus on building technically robust, trustworthy systems using proven open-source tools.

By combining DataOps principles with practical trust patterns, DTE bridges the gap between governance aspirations and engineering reality. It provides actionable frameworks that engineers can immediately implement, fostering collaboration rather than imposing top-down mandates.

## The Evolution Beyond Data Governance

Traditional data governance emerged in the post-SOX era with good intentions, but often struggles to adapt to modern cloud-native and AI-driven requirements. Many organizations find that governance initiatives create more complexity than they solve, particularly when compliance requirements overshadow technical data management needs.

DTE represents a practical evolution—an engineering-focused approach that emphasizes implementation over process, collaboration over mandates, and measurable outcomes over theoretical frameworks.

## The Problem: Process Over Engineering

Data governance initiatives, while well-intentioned, often prioritize process documentation over practical engineering solutions. This approach can create barriers for engineering teams who need to deliver working systems quickly. Organizations frequently encounter implementation challenges when governance requirements become disconnected from actual data workflows.

AI introduces additional complexity—teams need practical approaches for bias monitoring, drift detection, and model validation that integrate seamlessly with existing development practices.

## The Solution: Data Trust Engineering

DTE provides practical, engineering-driven patterns for building trustworthy data systems. By focusing on certification by use case, risk, and business value, DTE enables teams to implement trust measures that align with their specific operational needs.

DTE combines DataOps agility with practical trust patterns, ensuring reliable systems for critical use cases like AI model training and regulatory reporting. It separates technical data management from compliance concerns, allowing engineering teams to focus on building robust systems while supporting audit and legal requirements indirectly.

DTE works effectively across cloud-native architectures, data mesh implementations, and real-time analytics environments, addressing practical gaps where operational focus meets governance requirements.

## Getting Started with DTE

Organizations can adopt DTE through practical, incremental steps:

**Phase 1: Assessment** - Identify high-value use cases where trust certification provides immediate benefits. Evaluate existing data quality tools and establish practical baseline metrics.

**Phase 2: Pilot Implementation** - Select one critical use case and implement DTE patterns using familiar tools like Great Expectations for validation and OpenLineage for metadata tracking. Focus on measurable outcomes that demonstrate value.

**Phase 3: Scale and Collaborate** - Expand successful patterns to additional use cases, share learnings with the broader community, and refine approaches based on real-world feedback.

**Phase 4: Community Integration** - Engage with the DTE community, contribute successful patterns, and help shape shared best practices that benefit the entire ecosystem.

## Core Principles of DTE

1. **Trust**: Data systems must be accurate, secure, and accessible, building confidence across teams and stakeholders.

1. **Engineering Rigor**: DTE applies software engineering best practices—automation, testing, and iterative improvement—to data systems.

1. **Adaptability Through Feedback**: Continuous feedback loops enable teams to rapidly test, measure, and optimize data trust implementations.

1. **Enablement**: DTE empowers data professionals to deliver value, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

1. **Cloud-Native**: DTE aligns with modern cloud architectures and shared responsibility models.

1. **Certification by Use Case, Risk, and Value**: DTE provides practical assurance frameworks tailored to specific business contexts, supporting compliance goals through technical excellence rather than process overhead.

1. **Technical Debt Management**: DTE treats data quality as manageable technical debt, using practical tools to identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

1. **Community-Driven**: DTE evolves through open collaboration, welcoming contributions from diverse perspectives and experiences.

1. **Not a Governance Framework**: DTE is not a replacement for governance but a practical complement that focuses on engineering implementation.

1. **Not a Tool**: DTE is not a specific software platform but a collection of patterns and principles that guide implementation.

1. **Vendor Neutrality**: DTE emphasizes open-source tools and community-developed approaches, avoiding vendor lock-in.

1. **Independence from Compliance**: DTE provides technical foundations that support compliance without becoming compliance-driven.

1. **Not Policy-Driven**: DTE rejects rigid policy mandates in favor of adaptable engineering practices.

## Why DTE Succeeds

- **Technical Debt Discipline**: Proactive approaches to data quality that prevent downstream issues.

- **Engineering Integration**: Trust measures built into development workflows rather than added as afterthoughts.

## Observability and Provenance Over Static Policy

DTE emphasizes dynamic, observable approaches over rigid policies. Real-time monitoring, metadata tracking, and feedback loops enable teams to maintain trust as systems evolve and requirements change.

## Understanding Traditional Data Governance Context

Data governance originated with good intentions around financial integrity and regulatory compliance. However, many organizations find that traditional governance approaches struggle to adapt to modern cloud-native and AI-driven requirements. Implementation challenges are common when governance becomes disconnected from actual engineering workflows.

Some approaches, like data contracts, show promise when implemented as practical engineering patterns rather than theoretical frameworks.

**Key Considerations:**
- Implementation challenges often stem from complexity rather than technical limitations
- Value depends on organizational context and specific use cases
- Overly broad governance scopes can limit practical implementation

## Reframing Data Quality as Technical Debt Management

DTE treats data quality as manageable technical debt rather than an abstract compliance requirement. Using practical tools and early validation approaches, teams can identify and resolve quality issues before they impact production systems.
