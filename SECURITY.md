# Security Policy

At **Data Trust Engineering (DTE)**, we prioritize the security of our artifacts, such as the [DTE Trust Dashboard](/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard), and the trust of our community. If you discover a security vulnerability or need to report a Code of Conduct violation privately, please follow these steps.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Submit Privately**: Use our [security form](https://forms.gle/3fvhL9cqNiqe8VbV6) to report vulnerabilities or sensitive issues (e.g., data exposure in a script, Code of Conduct violations).
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide updates on resolution.
- **Details Needed**:
  - Description of the issue (e.g., “XSS in Trust Dashboard”).
  - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept.
  - Impact (e.g., “Could affect user data privacy”).
- **Do Not**: Disclose vulnerabilities publicly (e.g., GitHub Issues, Slack) until resolved.

## Community Guidelines
