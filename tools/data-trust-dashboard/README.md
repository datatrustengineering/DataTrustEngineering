# Data Trust Engineering (DTE) Trust Dashboard

Welcome to the **Data Trust Engineering (DTE) Trust Dashboard**, a flagship artifact of the *Data Trust Engineering* movement. This open-source dashboard visualizes key AI governance metrics—fairness, data drift, compliance, and model accuracy—in real-time, embodying DTE’s principles of trust, engineering rigor, and AI-readiness. Inspired by the agility and collaboration of the [DataOps Manifesto](https://dataopsmanifesto.org), this dashboard empowers data teams to build trusted, scalable systems, leaving behind the 70-85% failure rates of traditional data governance (Gartner, 2025).

## About Data Trust Engineering (DTE)

DTE is a revolutionary approach to data management, replacing bureaucratic governance with engineering-driven trust. It decouples compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC) from technical data management, focusing on quality, lineage, security, and AI-readiness. Built on DataOps principles like automation and collaboration, DTE ensures data is reliable, scalable, and ready for cloud and AI ecosystems.

## The DTE Trust Dashboard

The DTE Trust Dashboard is a practical, open-source tool that brings DTE to life. Built with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org), it provides real-time monitoring of:
- **Fairness**: Bar chart showing demographic parity scores across groups, ensuring equitable AI outcomes (integrates with Fairlearn).
- **Data Drift**: Line chart tracking drift scores over time, with thresholds for retraining triggers (integrates with Evidently AI).
- **Compliance**: Doughnut chart showing GDPR adherence, fostering regulatory trust.
- **Model Accuracy**: Line chart monitoring model performance, ensuring reliability (integrates with MLflow).

**DataOps Integration**:
- **Agility**: Features a "Refresh Data" button for real-time updates, simulating continuous monitoring (DataOps Principle #1).
- **Collaboration**: Open-source and extensible, inviting community contributions (DataOps Principle #4).
- **Engineering Rigor**: Built with robust, lightweight tools, compatible with Apache Superset for scalability (DataOps Principle #7).

The dashboard is housed in `/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html` and can be extended with APIs or additional metrics.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the Dashboard**:
   - Open `DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html` in a browser for a local preview.
   - Host on GitHub Pages or a web server for team access.
   - For production, integrate with APIs (e.g., Evidently AI for drift, MLflow for model metrics) to replace simulated data.

2. **Explore the Code**:
   - File: `/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html`
   - Tech Stack: HTML, JavaScript, Chart.js
   - Customization: Modify Chart.js configurations or add metrics (e.g., bias-variance tradeoffs) via pull requests.

3. **Integrate with Tools**:
   - **Data Quality**: Use Great Expectations for automated validation.
   - **Lineage**: Pair with Apache Atlas for metadata tracking.
   - **AI Governance**: Connect to Fairlearn (fairness), Evidently AI (drift), MLflow (retraining), or SDV (synthetic data).

## Why It Matters

Traditional data governance fails 70-85% of the time (Gartner, 2025) due to bureaucracy and misalignment with modern data needs. The DTE Trust Dashboard, inspired by the [DataOps Manifesto](https://dataopsmanifesto.org)’s focus on agility and engineering rigor, empowers data teams to:
- Build **trust** with transparent metrics for fairness and compliance.
- Enable **AI-readiness** by monitoring drift and accuracy.
- Scale with **cloud-native** architectures, aligning with shared responsibility models.
- Foster **collaboration**, inviting community contributions to evolve DTE.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/DataTrustEngineering.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the dashboard:
   ```bash
   cd tools/data-trust-dashboard
   ```
3. Open `DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html` in a browser or deploy to a server.
4. Customize data sources by updating the `refreshData()` function with your API endpoints.
