Trust. Engineered. Evolving with Community.
```

**Data Trust Engineering (DTE)** is a movement to end the 70-85% failure rate of traditional data governance (Gartner, 2025) and replace it with trust, engineering rigor, and AI-readiness. Inspired by the agility and collaboration of the [DataOps Manifesto](https://dataopsmanifesto.org), DTE empowers data teams to build reliable, scalable systems for cloud and AI. Starting with the **DTE Trust Dashboard**, our first artifact, we invite the community to contribute tools, patterns, and case studies to shape the future of data management. Join us at [datatrustmanifesto.org](https://datatrustmanifesto.org) and fuel the #DTERevolution!

## Why DTE?

Data governance, rooted in the SOX era of 2002, is a bureaucratic relic that conflates compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC) with technical data management, alienating engineers and stifling innovation. With 60% of AI data management projects failing by 2027 (MIT Technology Review, 2025), we need a new approach. DTE delivers:
- **Trust**: Accurate, secure, accessible data that earns confidence across enterprises, SMBs, and hyperscalers.
- **Engineering Rigor**: Automated, observable systems, inspired by DataOps principles (e.g., continuous monitoring, collaboration).
- **AI-Readiness**: Tackles fairness, data drift, retraining, and synthetic data for robust AI governance.
- **Cloud-Native**: Aligns with shared responsibility models (AWS, Azure) for scalable, hybrid architectures.
- **Community-Driven**: Evolves through open-source contributions, not top-down policies.

DTE is for enterprises needing reliability, SMBs seeking agility, hyperscalers pushing metadata-driven innovation, and tech communities craving a DevOps-like revolution for data.

## The DTE Trust Dashboard: Our First Artifact

The **DTE Trust Dashboard** is the first of many open-source artifacts to demonstrate DTE’s principles. Built with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org), it visualizes AI governance metrics in real-time:
- **Fairness**: Demographic parity scores to ensure equitable AI outcomes (integrates with Fairlearn).
- **Data Drift**: Tracks drift over time, flagging retraining needs (integrates with Evidently AI).
- **Compliance**: Monitors GDPR adherence for regulatory trust.
- **Model Accuracy**: Tracks performance to ensure reliability (integrates with MLflow).

**DataOps-Inspired Features**:
- **Agility**: Real-time data refresh for continuous monitoring (DataOps Principle #1).
- **Collaboration**: Open-source, inviting community enhancements (DataOps Principle #4).
- **Engineering Rigor**: Lightweight, robust visualizations compatible with Apache Superset (DataOps Principle #7).

Find it in `/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html`. This is just the start—more artifacts (e.g., data quality scripts, lineage trackers) are coming!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/DataTrustEngineering.git
   ```

2. **Try the Trust Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/tools/data-trust-dashboard`.
   - Open `DTE_Trust_Dashboard.html` in a browser for a local preview.
   - Host on GitHub Pages or a server for team access.
   - Customize with APIs (e.g., Evidently AI, MLflow) for live data.

3. **Read the Manifesto**:
   - Explore the [DTE Manifesto](/Manifesto.md) for the full vision of replacing data governance.

4. **Integrate with Tools**:
   - **Data Quality**: Great Expectations for automated validation.
   - **Lineage**: Apache Atlas for metadata tracking.
   - **AI Governance**: Fairlearn (fairness), Evidently AI (drift), MLflow (retraining), SDV (synthetic data).

## Repository Structure

- `/Manifesto.md`: The *Data Trust Engineering Manifesto*, defining DTE’s vision and principles.
- `/tools`: Home for DTE artifacts, starting with `/tools/data-trust-dashboard`.
- `/docs`: Case studies, implementation guides, and DTE patterns.
- `/community`: Contribution guidelines and resources.
- `/LICENSE.md`: MIT License for open collaboration.

## Contributing

The Trust Dashboard is just the beginning! Help shape DTE by contributing:
- **New Artifacts**: Add tools like data quality scripts, lineage trackers, or AI governance modules to `/tools`.
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Improve the Trust Dashboard with real-time APIs or new metrics (e.g., bias-variance tradeoffs) in `/tools/data-trust-dashboard`.
- **Case Studies**: Share DTE success stories in `/docs/case-studies`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/community/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. Submit pull requests or join the discussion on [X](https://x.com) with #DTERevolution.

## Roadmap

- **Q4 2025**: Launch new artifacts (e.g., data lineage tool, quality validator) and enhance Trust Dashboard with WebSocket updates.
- **Q1 2026**: Publish case studies from enterprises, SMBs, and hyperscalers in `/docs/case-studies`.
- **Q2 2026**: Expand [datatrustmanifesto.org](https://datatrustmanifesto.org) with tutorials, artifact showcases, and a community hub.

## Why It Matters

Data governance fails 70-85% of the time (Gartner, 2025) due to bureaucracy and misalignment with cloud and AI. DTE, inspired by the [DataOps Manifesto](https://dataopsmanifesto.org), delivers:
- **Trust**: Transparent metrics for fairness and compliance.
- **Engineering Excellence**: Scalable, automated systems for data and AI.
- **Community Power**: Open-source collaboration to build the future of data management.
