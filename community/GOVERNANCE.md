title: Governance of Data Trust Engineering (DTE)
---

The **Data Trust Engineering (DTE)** project is a community-driven initiative that provides practical patterns and tools for implementing data trust in AI and analytics systems, as outlined in the [Data Trust Engineering Manifesto](/Manifesto.md). DTE evolves through open-source collaboration on GitHub, with contributions ranging from working artifacts like the [DTE Trust Dashboard](/tools/data-trust-dashboard/DTE_Trust_Dashboard) to documentation and patterns. This `GOVERNANCE.md` file defines how our community makes decisions, manages contributions, and ensures productive collaboration.

## Guiding Principles

DTE's governance is guided by practical principles that support effective community collaboration:

- **Transparency**: Decisions are made openly, with clear rationale documented in GitHub Issues and Discussions.
- **Collaboration**: Community members from diverse backgrounds contribute tools, patterns, and documentation.
- **Alignment**: All decisions support DTE's focus on practical engineering approaches to data trust.
- **Inclusivity**: We welcome diverse perspectives while maintaining productive focus, as outlined in our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Agility**: We prioritize responsive feedback and iterative improvements to serve community needs.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Maintainers**:
  - **Who**: Initially, Brian Brewer (bbrewer@infolibcorp.com) and future contributors elevated based on sustained community contributions.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Review and merge pull requests (PRs) for alignment with community standards.
    - Moderate discussions, issues, and PRs per [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
    - Make final decisions on contributions and conflicts, incorporating community input.
    - Maintain repository structure and documentation as the community grows.
  - **Selection**: New maintainers are nominated by existing maintainers based on consistent, valuable contributions and community trust. Nominations are discussed in GitHub Discussions and confirmed by consensus.

- **Contributors**:
  - **Who**: Anyone who submits PRs, issues, or participates in Discussions/Slack, from newcomers to experienced practitioners.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](/community/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
    - Propose artifacts, patterns, or documentation improvements that benefit the community.
    - Engage constructively and respond to feedback during PR reviews.

- **Community Members**:
  - **Who**: Anyone participating in GitHub Discussions, Slack, or community channels.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Provide feedback, propose ideas, and help spread awareness of DTE approaches.
    - Report concerns about community standards to maintainers.

## Decision-Making Process

DTE uses a **consensus-oriented approach** to balance community input with practical decision-making, similar to successful open-source projects. Key decisions include PR approvals, new artifacts, documentation updates, and governance changes.

1. **Proposal**:
   - Ideas are proposed via GitHub Issues or community channels.
   - Use clear issue templates for proposals (e.g., "New Pattern: Data Quality Validation").

2. **Discussion**:
   - Community members discuss proposals in GitHub Issues or Discussions.
   - Maintainers facilitate productive dialogue and keep discussions focused.

3. **Decision**:
   - For routine changes (e.g., documentation updates, small PRs), maintainers approve based on alignment with community standards.
   - For significant changes (e.g., new patterns, governance updates), maintainers seek community input for 5-7 days. If consensus isn't reached, maintainers make the final decision with documented rationale.
   - Example: Adding a new pattern requires maintainer review and community feedback.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Decisions are documented in GitHub Issues with clear explanations.

## Pull Request (PR) Review and Approval

PRs are the primary way to contribute to DTE. The process follows [CONTRIBUTING.md](/community/CONTRIBUTING.md):

1. **Submission**:
   - Contributors submit PRs with clear descriptions.
   - Link to related GitHub Issues for context.

2. **Review Criteria**:
   - **Alignment**: Does the PR provide practical value to the community?
   - **Quality**: Is the contribution clear, functional, and well-documented?
   - **Relevance**: Does it fit DTE's focus on data trust engineering?
   - Maintainers provide feedback within 5-7 days.

3. **Automated Checks**:
   - Markdown linting ensures documentation consistency.
   - Code contributions should include basic validation or examples.

4. **Approval**:
   - PRs require at least one maintainer approval to merge.
   - Significant changes need additional maintainer review and community feedback.
   - Feedback is provided constructively for all contributions.

5. **Merge**:
   - Approved PRs are merged into the main branch, with contributors credited.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are resolved transparently and constructively:

- **Step 1: Discussion**:
  - Address conflicts in GitHub Issues, Discussions, or community channels.
  - Maintainers facilitate respectful dialogue per [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- **Step 2: Mediation**:
  - If consensus isn't reached within 5 days, maintainers propose solutions.
  - Community input is sought for significant conflicts.

- **Step 3: Final Decision**:
  - Maintainers make final decisions when needed, with documented rationale.
  - Example: Technical disagreements may be resolved through compromise or additional review.

- **Step 4: Enforcement**:
  - Code of Conduct violations are addressed with appropriate actions as outlined in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Community Engagement

DTE thrives on community participation. Ways to engage:

- **GitHub Discussions**: Propose ideas, provide feedback, or discuss artifacts.
- **Slack**: Join [datatrustengineering]([Slack Invite Link]) for collaboration.
- **Good First Issues**: Start with beginner-friendly tasks to learn and contribute.
- **Recognition**: Valuable contributions are acknowledged in community channels.

## Evolving Governance

As DTE grows, governance adapts to community needs:

- **Feedback**: Community members can propose governance improvements via GitHub Issues.
- **Updates**: Significant changes require community discussion and maintainer consensus.
- **Scaling**: If community size warrants, we may transition to organizational structures while maintaining these principles.
